    "text": "Description\nAs the pharmaceutical field moves to open-source solutions for reporting on clinical trials, assessing and vetting the options available becomes increasingly important. The {gtsummary} R package is the most widely used tool in the R ecosystem for creating publication-ready summary tables. Its recent integration with the Analysis Results Dataset (ARD) framework represents a major advance for clinical trial reporting. ARDs, which standardize statistical outputs in a machine-readable format, can be robustly generated using the open-source {cards} package developed by Roche, GSK, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and Clymb.\nIn this seminar, attendees will learn about ARDs and how can fit into the larger CDISC-proposed Analysis Results Standard, get hands-on experience using {cards} to build ARDs for both simple and complex statistical summaries, create summary tables using the {gtsummary} package, and learn how utilizing these packages together also makes programmatic quality control of TLGs a simple task.\nLastly, we will review how this ecosystem naturally lends itself to Large Language Models (LLMs). Because {gtsummary} is so widely adopted, LLMs can generate complex {gtsummary} code without additional training. Additionally, LLMs can readily interpret our structured ARDs to assist medical writers summarizing both simple and sophisticated trial results.",
