## Description

As the pharmaceutical field moves to open-source solutions for reporting on clinical trials, assessing and vetting the options available becomes increasingly important.
The {gtsummary} R package is the most widely used tool in the R ecosystem for creating publication-ready summary tables.
Its recent integration with the Analysis Results Dataset (ARD) framework represents a major advance for clinical trial reporting.
ARDs, which standardize statistical outputs in a machine-readable format, can be robustly generated using the open-source {cards} package developed by Roche\Genentech, GSK, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and Clymb.

In this seminar, attendees will learn about ARDs and how can fit into the larger CDISC-proposed Analysis Results Standard, get hands-on experience using {cards} to build ARDs for both simple and complex statistical summaries, create summary tables using the {gtsummary} package, and learn how utilizing these packages together also makes programmatic quality control of TLGs a simple task.

Lastly, we will review how this ecosystem naturally lends itself to Large Language Models (LLMs).
Because {gtsummary} is so widely adopted, LLMs can generate complex {gtsummary} code without additional training.
Additionally, LLMs can readily interpret our structured ARDs to assist medical writers summarizing both simple and sophisticated trial results.
